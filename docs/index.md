** This document is not intended for cora customers(who buys cora as an IP, or chip) at this moment, you need to get the permission to be a cora developer first, by sending a request to redpanda3.**

**[CORA](https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv5966816) is created by nprocessor developers. It is an [NVDLA](https://nvdla.org/) extension for common algorithms in self-driving cars, such as control, localization, and path planning.**

##  Current Working Directories

### **cora**

Mainly inherited from [soDLA](https://github.com/soDLA-publishment/soDLA), which is the chisel implementation of NVDLA. It is the **chisel code(RTL) of cora**.

### **npc_cocotb**

**The verilog testbench of all the nprocessor projects(soDLA and cora)**, you need to install [cocotb](https://github.com/cocotb/cocotb) first. 


### **timestamped**

Although patent can be a powerful method to protect IPs, however, applying for patent can be a painful work, we might lose concentrations into the **meaningful** development by putting too much effort into applying patent. 

The most important thing, is that we have to protect our own IPs by ourselves, not by other people.

Timestamping those IPs can be a **weakly defensive method to avoid [patent troll](https://wiki.mbalib.com/wiki/%E4%B8%93%E5%88%A9%E6%B5%81%E6%B0%93)**. 

### **others**

Some back-end flows.
