[Proof of Work](mining/overview.md) miners play a similar role for Decred as they do for Bitcoin, but with Decred they only receive 60% of the block reward.

[Proof of Stake](proof-of-stake/overview.md) voting is central to Decred's governance. Decred holders can time-lock (or "stake") DCR to obtain voting tickets. Tickets are randomly called to vote on-chain; this involves both approving the work of PoW miners and voting Yes/No on any open [rule change proposals](governance/consensus-rule-voting/overview.md). 30% of the block reward goes to the holders of the tickets that voted in that block.

The remaining 10% of the block reward goes into the [Decred Treasury](https://dcrdata.decred.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx). Holders of live tickets decide how that treasury is used through [Politeia proposals and voting](governance/politeia/overview.md).

The [Decred Constitution](governance/decred-constitution.md) sets out some guiding principles for the project; the constitution is subject to amendment through Politeia proposals.
